Prior, he was faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as assistant professor in 2003. In 2014, he was awarded the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Patterns in Mixed-language Systems. In 2013-2014, he visited KAIST, Yonsei U., and Seoul National University, in Korea, as well as the National Institute of Informatics, in Japan, during his sabbatical year. In 2010, he became IEEE Senior Member. In 2009, he obtained the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Software Patterns and Patterns of Software. In 2003, he received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointes supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. In 1998, he graduated as engineer from École des Mines of Nantes. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He was the first to use explanation-based constraint programming in the context of software engineering to identify occurrences of patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering; he uses eye-trackers to understand and to develop theories about program comprehension. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM\/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER.

The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles.

His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), and more than 170 scientific papers and articles. He is actively involved in organisation of scientific conferences and is member of the editorial board of several journals. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards.

His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), and more than 170 scientific papers and articles. He is actively involved in organisation of scientific conferences and is member of the editorial board of several journals. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards.

The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), and more than 170 scientific papers and articles.

Through empirical studies, he has identified practitioners pain points, characterized the limitations of AI4SE solutions, and explored practitioners acceptance thresholds for AI-powered tools. He regularly contributes to the MSR conference and works on various MSR topics, including how MSR provides insight into the reliability of machine learning (ISSRE12) and powers automated program repair (SANER16). His contributions have led to over 20 awards, including two Test-of-Time awards and eleven ACM SIGSOFT\/IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper awards, and his work has garnered over 38,000 citations. An ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, ASE Fellow, and National Research Foundation Investigator (Senior Fellow), Lo has also served as the GC of MSR22 and ASE16, and as a PC Co-Chair for ASE20, FSE24, and ICSE25.

His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles.

His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development.

The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles.

The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles.

The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles.
